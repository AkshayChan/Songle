# Songle

This a basic android app which is a bit like the Pokemon Go of Songs

The user can collect words from a specific song walking around a map by clicking on the placemark when his current location
is close enough to the placemark. There are 5 maps for each song with each map progressively more specific in terms of the type 
of words appearing. 

The user can then review the words and guess the song or skip the song and see the answer. The users' score is calculated on 
the basis of the total number of songs correctly guessed, total number of songs skipped and the net words collected across all songs.
Lesser words will yield a better score, and the number of guesses are irrelevant to the score.
